## Bundles

This is the heart of Statika library. Bundles... 

A bundle is supposed to be a lightweight cover for any kind of "modules" of any system, such as a tool (program) installer, data object, code library, etc.

This bundle covering is needed to have control on their dependencies on the level of Scala type 
system. So the main part of the bundle is it's dependencies declaration (which is just a set of
other bundles).

A bundle can do something valuable, for instance, to install some tool assuming that all it's
dependencies are already installed, or it can deploy some data and provide a convenient interface
for the bundles which are dependent on it. For these purposes, there is an `install` method. All 
the work with environment should be done there.

        a type-safe interface for interaction with it);
      - if it's a _library_, nothing;

      So this method contains any bundle's interaction with the environment and that's why it
      requires a distribution (see also `Distribution.scala`).

/* ### Auxiliary stuff

This constructor is convenient, because it takes just a value for the bundle dependencies and sets 
the type-members and evaluates `depsTower`.

If you want to inherit from this class _abstractly_, you need to preserve the same implicit context and then you can extend it, providing the types explicitly. See [Distribution code](Distribution.md) for example.
